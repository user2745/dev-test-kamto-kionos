# DeFi Real Estate - Take-Home Assessment

Thank you for your interest in joining our team!  
This is a short take-home task to evaluate your skills with backend and smart contract code.

---

## Objective

Your goal is to review asmart contract small codebase, fix bugs, and improve testing for the backend API and smart contracts related to property transactions.

This task should take approximately **40 minutes**.

## What to Do

1. **Set Up**

   - Clone the provided code repository (or access the codebase files)
   - Setup the node version:

     nvm i 20.19.6
     nvm use 20.19.6
     ```
   - Install dependencies with:

     npm start
     ```
   - The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (if applicable)

2. **Review & Fix**

   - Check the backend code (Node.js) for bugs or issues
   - Review the smart contract code (Solidity) for bugs or missing features
   - Fix identified bugs
   - Add simple tests if missing (e.g., basic unit tests for smart contracts or API endpoints)

3. **Submit**

   - Push your changes via a pull request or share the updated code package
   - Briefly describe what you fixed or changed

## Focus Areas

- Backend API (Node.js)
- Smart contracts (Solidity)
- Basic tests (if any are missing or incomplete)

---

## Notes

- Keep your changes simple and clear
- Focus on high-impact bugs or issues
- You can use test networks or mock data as needed
